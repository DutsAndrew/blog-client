**Blog Client**

A Front-End Application for users to freely view, interact with, and view posts. This Client pulls from a NodeJS API to render content for the user to see. If the user wants to create posts they will be redirected to a CMS (Content-Management-System) website that handles adding things to the API, which requires user authentication.

*Tools*
NextJS, TypeScript, React, CSS

The corresponding applications that run in conjunction with the client can be found here:

1. Blog-API - for handling requests to and from the database
2. Blog-CMS - for authenticating users to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations in the database
